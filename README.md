An intelligent email management and outreach tool that provides real-time email synchronization, AI-powered categorization, powerful search capabilities, and RAG-based suggested replies.

## ‚ú® Features

* **‚ö° Real-Time Email Sync:** Uses **IMAP IDLE** for event-driven, real-time synchronization of multiple email accounts without polling. Maintains persistent connections and handles reconnects automatically.
* **üîç Powerful Search:** All incoming emails are immediately indexed in **Elasticsearch**, enabling full-text search on subjects and bodies, along with fast keyword filtering by account or folder.
* **ü§ñ AI Email Categorization:** Leverages the **Gemini LLM API** to automatically classify emails into one of five key labels: `Interested`, `Meeting Booked`, `Not Interested`, `Spam`, or `Out of Office`.
* **üîó Smart Integrations:** Sends instant notifications to **Slack** and triggers external **webhooks** for important events, such as when an email is categorized as `Interested`.
* **üí° RAG-Based Suggested Replies (Bonus):** Generates context-aware, professional reply suggestions. It converts email text into embeddings, retrieves relevant context from a **Qdrant Vector DB**, and uses the Gemini API to craft a concise reply.
* **üñ•Ô∏è Simple Frontend UI:** A clean interface to display emails, filter by account/folder, view AI category tags, and utilize the search functionality.

### 3. Project Initialization

Clone the repository and initialize the project.

```bash
# Create and navigate into the project directory
mkdir reachinbox-onebox
cd reachinbox-onebox

# Initialize a Node.js project
npm init -y

# Set up TypeScript
npm install typescript @types/node ts-node --save-dev
npx tsc --init

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages for the project.

```bash
npm install express node-imap @elastic/elasticsearch dotenv node-fetch

### 5. Start Services with Docker

This project relies on Elasticsearch and Qdrant, which will run in Docker containers.

First, create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.1
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
      - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
    volumes:
      - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant
    ports:
      - 6333:6333
      - 6334:6334
    volumes:
      - qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage

volumes:
  esdata:
    driver: local
  qdrant_storage:
    driver: local

### 6. Run the Application

Once all dependencies are installed and the Docker services are running, you can start the application.

Run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
