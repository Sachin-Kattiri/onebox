# ReachInbox Onebox â€“ Real-Time AI Email Assistant

A real-time AI-powered email assistant that syncs emails via IMAP, indexes them for fast search, categorizes them using an LLM (Gemini API), triggers Slack/webhook notifications for interested leads, and suggests contextually relevant replies using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of three primary layers:

1. **IMAP Sync Service (Phase 1)**  
   - Maintains a persistent real-time connection with email servers using IMAP IDLE.  
   - Fetches initial emails and listens for new messages without polling.  
   - Extracts metadata and plaintext content for indexing.  

2. **Persistence Layer (Phase 2 & 6)**  
   - **Elasticsearch:** Stores email metadata and full-text content for search and filtering.  
   - **Vector Database (Qdrant):** Stores embeddings for RAG-based suggested replies.  

3. **API & Integration Layer (Phase 3, 4 & 6)**  
   - **Node.js/TypeScript REST API:** Serves search, filtering, and suggested replies.  
   - **Gemini LLM API:** Categorizes emails (`Interested`, `Meeting Booked`, `Not Interested`, `Spam`, `Out of Office`).  
   - **Slack/Webhook Integration:** Sends notifications for emails labeled as `Interested`.
